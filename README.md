Bullshit Bingo for those particularly long lectures and seminars

## Disclaimer
This project is in no way meant to demean anyone or to devalue the important work
that the professors, tutors and others do, without whom we would not make it a
single semester through University. But let's face it: Even the best tutors
cannot really make the driest math seminar fun. So this is something to do on the
side and maybe it might even help to pay a little closer attention.
